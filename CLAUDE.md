# IdealistaRank — Idealista Watch & Analyze

Guidance for AI agents and contributors. Deeper contracts: CONTRIBUTING.md
(setup, style, PR checklist), docs/DEV_RULES.md (dual-build ports and
isolation), MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md, docs/STATE.md.

## What this is

Self-hosted Flask app that ingests Idealista saved-search alert emails
(Gmail IMAP), stores listings in PostgreSQL, classifies and scores them
(investment / lifestyle / combined), enriches them via Google APIs
(Places, Distance Matrix), runs paid AI analysis (Anthropic Claude,
OpenAI), and tracks listing status by scraping idealista.com behind a
deliberate throttle. Personal tool, single owner, runs in local Docker.
English/Spanish UI.

## Stack

Python 3.11+ · Flask 3 + Flask-SQLAlchemy (SQLAlchemy 2) · PostgreSQL ·
gunicorn · APScheduler · Flask-Limiter (redis) · Flask-WTF (CSRF) ·
imapclient · anthropic SDK · Google API clients · uv (`uv.lock`) · pytest.

## Run

```bash
docker compose up -d --build                 # app on http://localhost:5001/
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up  # dev variant with --reload
pytest tests/ -v                             # test suite
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html    # coverage report
```

The current main line is the "universal" build (cutover finalized; legacy
`/lands` redirects to `/properties`). The dual-build isolation contract
from the transition — legacy on 5001 vs universal on 5050, unique Docker
names, separate IMAP labels and cookie names — lives in docs/DEV_RULES.md
and TODO.md; respect it if you ever run both side by side.

## Layout

- `app.py` — Flask application factory (validates required secrets at
  startup and fails fast); `main.py` — entrypoint
- `routes/` — `main_routes` (pages), `api_routes` (JSON API),
  `language_routes` (i18n switching)
- `services/` — business logic: email ingestion (`property_imap_service`,
  `imap_service`), classification (`property_classification_service`),
  scoring (`property_scoring_service`, `scoring_service`), enrichment
  (`property_enrichment_service`, `enrichment_service`), travel times
  (`travel_time_service`, `property_travel_service`), listing status
  scraping with throttle (`listing_status_service`), market analysis, AI
  (`anthropic_service`, `openai_service`, `property_ai_service`),
  `scheduler_service`, `background_jobs`
- `models.py` — SQLAlchemy models; `migrations/` — schema migrations
- `utils/` — `auth` (admin_required, rate limits), `security`, `cache`,
  `email_parser`, `idealista_extractors`, bulk tools
  (`bulk_ai_analysis`, `recalc_travel_times`)
- `templates/`, `static/` — Jinja2, Bootstrap, minimal vanilla JS/HTMX
- `tests/` — pytest suite; external APIs are mocked
- `docs/` — DEV_RULES.md, STATE.md, UNIVERSAL_PROPERTIES.md,
  PROPERTY_TYPES.md

## Hard rules

- Never read or echo `.env` — it holds IMAP and API credentials. Required
  config is validated at startup and fails fast; do not add silent
  fallbacks around it.
- External APIs cost real money (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Places /
  Distance Matrix). Never run bulk backfills (`utils/bulk_ai_analysis.py`,
  `utils/recalc_travel_times.py`) without an explicit ticket saying so.
- Preserve the scraping throttle in `services/listing_status_service.py`
  (randomized sleeps between listing fetches). No bulk re-scrape loops.
- Security posture is hard-won: `admin_required` on state-changing
  endpoints, CSRF protection, rate limiting, parameterized queries only.
  Treat any weakening as a defect. An open security/bug audit lives in
  GitHub issues #16–#30.
- Never change existing primary key types. Schema changes go through
  migrations (see MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md).
- Mock external API calls in tests. Suites needing live services or
  credentials are reported as skipped, never as passed.

## Workflow

- GitHub issues are the source of truth for tasks:
  https://github.com/sergi039/idealista-tracker-ai/issues. An AgentsRoom
  board card, when used, is only a launch wrapper titled `#NN: …`.
- Branch from `main` (agent branches use `claude/**` or `codex/**`
  prefixes), merge back via PR. There is no CI yet (issue #31): run
  `pytest tests/ -v` locally before claiming done and paste real output.
- A local PostToolUse hook auto-runs `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format`
  on edited Python files — do not fight it.
