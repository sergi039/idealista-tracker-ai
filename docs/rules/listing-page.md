# The /properties page: sorts, layout, controls, beaches

Moved verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` (lines 594–682 at commit 8697ff7,
2026-09-03): the long form of the one-line rules `CLAUDE.md` keeps. Nothing
below was rewritten. "Above", "below" and "this file" refer to the order the
text had in `CLAUDE.md`; `docs/rules/README.md` lists the files in that order.

**The "to beach" sort is live** (issue #271, PR #272): the Phase-2 backfill
put measured beach times into `travel["beaches"]`, so the old #98 placeholder
("not one row holds a travel time") is retired. The list sort and the CSV
export share one `_nearest_beach_minutes` expression
(`routes/main_routes.py`) that reads the nearest measured beach and is NULL
without one, so unmeasured rows sort last in either direction — they are
never presented as a measured absence. The #98 distinction still governs the
*values*: a refusal is recorded, never cached, and never becomes a zero. Rows
outside the backfill scope (last 30 days + favorites) stay manual via the
per-property Enrich button. `tests/test_beach_sort_enabled.py` pins it.

**The page uses the width it has, and the table fits a tablet without
scrolling sideways.** Two rules in `static/css/style.css` do that, and both
are easy to break by accident. Above 768px `.container` drops Bootstrap's cap
(720px at md through 1320px at xxl) — **with no upper bound**, because the cap
is as wrong on a 2560px monitor, where the table became a strip down the
middle, as it is on an iPad. A first attempt stopped that rule at 1399.98px
and therefore changed nothing on the owner's own screen; do not reintroduce a
ceiling. Between 768px and 1200px the list table also shrinks its padding,
wraps its badges and (in portrait, under 992px) hides the Coords column, whose
municipality moves under the title instead. All of it only works because the
column widths live in `.col-*` classes rather than inline
`style="min-width: … !important"` attributes — an inline `!important` outranks
every media query, which is what made the table 1344px wide at any viewport.
`tests/test_tablet_list_layout.py` fails if those widths move back into the
markup or if the cap comes back.

**Every one of those controls exists exactly once** (owner decision,
2026-08-09, superseding "the page is a copy of the /lands layout"). The page
had grown a duplicate of nearly everything: a subscription dropdown in the
filter panel repeating the chips above it, an Archive dropdown repeating the
archive section inside that dropdown, Export CSV in the navbar *and* over the
list, Manual Sync in the header *and* in the navbar slot the page had taken.
What the page has now, top to bottom:

1. **Toolbar** (`#subscription-switcher`) — the subscription chips, one
   `More` menu holding what a chip cannot say (several at once, the archive,
   `unassigned`, an empty selection), and the Favorites / Hide removed
   switches. Those two are links, not form fields: they apply on click, and
   the filter form re-posts their state as hidden inputs so Apply cannot
   switch them off. The menu's checkboxes belong to the filter form through
   `form="filter-form"`, so a no-JavaScript Apply still carries them; with
   JavaScript they apply when the menu closes.
2. **Filter bar** (`#filters-card`) — one wrapping row, no captions above the
   controls. Each names itself in its first option (`All Types`, `All
   Municipalities`, `Inv. metr: all`); search leads it. Anything that changes
   *which* rows are shown lives here, and nothing else does.
3. **Result row** — the count, the modes, the cards/list toggle and Export
   CSV: the controls that change how the same rows are drawn.

Keep it that way. Adding a control means deciding which of the three it
belongs to, not adding a second copy near where it is needed.

**The beaches block is informational, and it must never move a score** (owner
decision, 2026-08-11). `Property.travel["beaches"]` holds every beach within a
20-minute drive (`BEACH_MAX_DRIVE_MIN`), nearest first, each linked to Google
Maps; a listing with none is shown no block at all, which is why an inland
property's right-hand column looks exactly as it did. It is *not* a travel
preset: presets resolve one place and feed the scorer, so a beach lookup Google
refuses is kept out of `travel["targets"]` and out of the run tally — a beach
must not turn a good travel run into a degraded one. The candidates ride in the
preset's own Distance Matrix batch, so the feature costs one extra Places call
per property and no extra route request — which holds only because the beaches
take the room the presets leave in that one request (six presets plus twenty
beaches is 26 destinations against a 25-destination limit, and the split would
be billed twice), and only candidates within 30 km in a straight line are
measured at all (a road is never shorter than that, so the
rest cannot come in under the limit and paying for them is waste). The four
statuses — `ok`, `none_within_limit`, `not_found`, `unavailable` — exist for the
#98 reason: only a *measured* absence hides the block, and a refusal still
renders, saying it was not measured. **The beaches come from `natural=beach` in OpenStreetMap since 2026-08-19**,
in the same Overpass query that answers the presets -- so the seventh and last
Places call a listing cost is gone, and the beaches read a cache entry the
presets have already filled. One consequence is worth knowing before it
surprises someone: sharing the query couples the two, so a refusal now refuses
both. The rule "a beach must never turn a good travel run into a degraded one"
survives in the only form it still has content in -- the beaches contribute
nothing to the target tally, and the run's verdict is whatever the presets
alone make it -- because the old scenario, a beach lookup failing while the
presets are fine, cannot occur when one query answers for all six. The
Places-era rules stay and mostly idle: they exist because `natural_feature` +
"playa" returned campsites and beach bars, and a claim about the ground has far
less to refuse. `natural_feature` + keyword `playa` was the
Places pair, measured against the live API on 2026-08-11: it returns real
beaches in Asturias *and* in Galicia (where they are named "Praia"), while the
legacy `tourist_attraction` + `playa` pair returned a fountain, a swimming pool
and the town itself. Google lists the same beach under several place ids, so
identical names are collapsed to the nearest one.
